# Reading Owl

A simple lateral reading program, built using ChatGPT API and Bing API. Use it to understand your biases, conduct research. or just learn something new.

## How to Use

Currently the only way to run the program is to clone it to your git, and then edit the run_temporary function as seen below.

<code>

    def run_temporary():
    
        input_text = "Enter opinion here."

</code>

Once you've entered the text, just run the program and observe the results in the terminal. 

You may need to download the libraries mentioned at the top of the functions.py file. Moreover, you will **need to have an API key** for ChatGPT and Bing to run the program.

## Looking Forward

The goal is create a dynamic website for the program and make it accessible to everyone. However, the use case will be limited due to my limited availability of the APIs. 

I'd like the users of the program to play around with the fucntions and the prompt to come up with interesting results. My current prompt is aimed towards an unbiased and rather bland response. But lateral reading can involve some level of jounralistic toning. If you do experiment, please do share the results.
